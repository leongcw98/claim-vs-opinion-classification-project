        "In the fast-paced world of TikTok, where millions of videos are shared daily, efficiently managing user reports is crucial for maintaining community standards and ensuring a positive user experience. To address the growing challenge of moderating reported content, we have embarked on an exciting data science initiative to enhance our content review process.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our goal is to leverage machine learning to differentiate between two types of content in user reports: claims and opinions. A claim is a statement asserting something as fact, often linked to potential violations of TikTok's community guidelines, whereas an opinion is a personal viewpoint that generally does not violate the platform's rules. By automating this initial classification, we aim to streamline the moderation workflow, enabling faster and more accurate prioritization of reports.\n",

        "This project involves developing a machine learning model that can efficiently classify videos as either claims or opinions.

        "To ensure our machine learning model is robust and effective, we follow a structured workflow with a focus on rigorous validation. Given our dataset of approximately 20,000 videos, we have designed our approach to ensure comprehensive model evaluation:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Splitting**: We partition the dataset into three subsets—**60% for training**, **20% for validation**, and **20% for testing**. This approach allows us to build and fine-tune the model while preserving a separate dataset for final evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Model Training and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Models are initially trained on the training set, where hyperparameters are tuned to optimize performance. This iterative process helps in identifying the best settings for each model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Validation and Model Selection**: After training, we evaluate model performance on the validation set. This stage is crucial for selecting the best-performing model based on metrics such as recall, which is essential for minimizing false negatives.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Final Assessment**: The selected model, or the \"champion model,\" is then assessed on the test set to gauge its performance in real-world scenarios. This final evaluation helps ensure the model's reliability and effectiveness before deployment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Through this methodical approach, we aim to develop a model that not only meets the immediate needs of content moderation but also enhances the overall user experience on TikTok. Let's dive into the details and see how our model performs in achieving these goals."

Videos that are labeled as claims will be further sorted by a downstream process to determine whether they should get prioritized for review.
